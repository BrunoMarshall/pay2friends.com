\# Pay2Friends



Social, Seamless, Scalable Payments on \*\*Shardeum\*\*



\## Abstract

Pay2Friends is a decentralized peer-to-peer payment solution powered by Shardeum's PayFi infrastructure.  

Designed to mirror the simplicity of PayPal but built for Web3, Pay2Friends empowers users to send micro and macro payments instantly and affordably across \*\*social, gaming, and local commerce platforms\*\*.  

Through a familiar UX and secure smart contracts, Pay2Friends aims to drive Web3 adoption with a \*\*user-centric approach\*\*.

\## Problem

Despite the rapid rise of Web3, payment systems remain \*\*fragmented, unintuitive, and inaccessible\*\* to everyday users.



\- Web2 systems (like PayPal) offer ease but lack decentralization and financial sovereignty.  

\- Most crypto wallets are not designed for \*\*real-time micro-transactions\*\* or \*\*user-friendly experiences\*\* needed in social, gaming, and local trade ecosystems.

\- \*\*Simple UX\*\*: Mimics PayPal’s intuitive interface.  

\- \*\*On Shardeum\*\*: Uses dynamic state sharding for scalability and ultra-low gas fees.  

\- \*\*Decentralized payments\*\*: Secure smart contracts \& wallet integrations.  

\- \*\*Contextual utility\*\*: Works inside gaming, social, and commerce apps.  

\- \*\*Social handles\*\*: Pay using `@handles` or email addresses instead of wallet addresses.
