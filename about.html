    <h1 class="centered-text">About Pay2Friends</h1>
    <p>Pay2Friends is a decentralized payment platform built on the Shardeum Unstablenet, designed to make crypto payments as simple as sending an email. Our mission is to empower anyone to send SHM, ERC-20 or our native P2F tokens to friends using their wallet address or email, all without intermediaries. Launched in 2025, Pay2Friends leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and community-driven transactions.</p>
    
    <h2 class="centered-text">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>We aim to redefine peer-to-peer payments by combining the ease of traditional apps like PayPal with the power of decentralization. Our goal is to build a platform that’s accessible to everyone, from crypto beginners to seasoned users. We’re inspired by the legendary PayPal Mafia, a group of innovators who transformed fintech, and we’re seeking passionate developers, designers, and visionaries to join our team and make Pay2Friends the next big thing in crypto.</p>
    
    <h2 class="centered-text">The P2F Token</h2>
    <p>The P2F token is our native token on Pay2Friends:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract Address</strong>: <a href="https://explorer-unstablenet.shardeum.org/address/0x30d16e2bd13bfdf42a47cc18468240bc3bed69ff" target="_blank">0x30d16e2bd13bfdf42a47cc18468240bc3bed69ff</a></li>
      <li><strong>Network</strong>: Shardeum Unstablenet (Chain ID: 8080)</li>
      <li><strong>Type</strong>: ERC-20</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Used for peer-to-peer payments within Pay2Friends, enabling fast and low-cost transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Features</strong>: Fully integrated with our smart contract for email-based transfers and transaction logging.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The P2F token is designed to incentivize community participation and could evolve to support governance or rewards as the platform grows.</p>
    
    <h2 class="centered-text">Future Ideas</h2>
    <p>We have big plans for Pay2Friends, and we’re excited to brainstorm with our future team. Some ideas include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mobile Apps</strong>: Develop iOS and Android apps to bring Pay2Friends to mobile users, making crypto payments as easy as a tap.</li>
      <li><strong>Email Verification</strong>: Explore solutions like Firebase Authentication for email ownership verification, while discussing fully decentralized alternatives (e.g., Sign-in with Ethereum or Ceramic) to maintain our ethos.</li>
      <li><strong>Transaction History</strong>: Add a feature to display past transfers, pulling data from the blockchain’s <code>TransferLogged</code> events.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Features</strong>: Enhance the friends list with social discovery, allowing users to find and connect with others on the platform.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-Chain Support</strong>: Expand to other blockchains for broader adoption.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These ideas will be refined with input from our community and team to ensure they align with our decentralized vision.</p>
    
    <h2 class="centered-text">Preventing Email Spoofing</h2>
    <p>Currently, users can register any email with our smart contract, which poses a risk of spoofing. To address this, we propose introducing a small registration fee (e.g., 1 P2F or 100 SHM) to deter fake registrations. This fee could be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refundable after a certain period or burned to support the ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Used to fund community initiatives or platform development.</li>
      <li>Adjustable based on network activity to balance accessibility and security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This proposal needs team discussion to ensure it’s fair and aligns with our goal of accessibility. We’re also exploring decentralized identity solutions to verify email ownership without centralized services.</p>
    
    <h2 class="centered-text">Join the Team</h2>
    <p>We’re looking for innovators to join our “Pay2Friends Mafia” and build the future of decentralized payments. Whether you’re a developer, designer, marketer, or crypto enthusiast, we want to hear from you. Together, we can take Pay2Friends to mobile apps, global adoption, and beyond.
